I have not tried in the office with Google Meet conference hardware, but will update when I do. -They don't have their own weird cloud. This app is standalone and does not need an account with whoever devs Squid. -You can lasso inserted photos and move them Bad: -The erase with your finger option is negated by the fact that when the palm rejection doesn't work (which happens often), ends up erasing your notes (I guess this is more problematic for me since I am left handed). I had to turn it off. -There is no option to auto backup to Google Drive or OneDrive. This is particularly upsetting, because unless you remember to manually backup, you may lose your device and your notes. To do that you would have to use Dropbox or Box (i am not about to get another service just for this app). Also, given that those two are the most popular cloud services for business, it makes it impossible for me to propose the adoption of this app at work. -This app is subscription based. Premium features cost per month/year... not single purchase like INKredible. I guess you can buy features one at a time, but that doesn't seem like a good idea to me. I am still on the fence of which app to keep.","-There is no option to auto backup to Google Drive or OneDrive.","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0"

For example, if you back out of a note, you should get a warning that your scribble is going to be lost...(uggh). I got lucky and somehow was able to pinch and zoom in -- but I have not been able to replicate something so simple. Clearly it's there -- somewhere, but not where would expect it to be consistently (e.g., everywhere would be nice for larger screen users like me). While you can re-size the note background, and scale the content to size -- you cannot move the block of content to make resizing the note more functional. Nor change the pen inking width (that I could find). Moving notes about -- it is very crude feeling for more serious matters. I have yet to find any 'gestures' to rotate notes, but I did find the 90-degree flip... (not like in the demo with slight rotations). I like the idea of the widget on my Fold3, but I find the integration to the main app to be just to awkward to use. It has plenty of potential -- any maybe buried or hidden functionality waiting for a spelunker. I am also sure it's great in select scenarios/use-cases. Overall, it is cute, but awkward. It stumbles as I tried to use it more... Also, some type of sync across devices would be helpful. The plumbing is already in, so provide an option to move the data to a cloud store (many to choose from) to support multiple devices. All in all, some cool stuff, light feel; but misses in a lot of places.
