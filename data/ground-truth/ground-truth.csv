For example, if you back out of a note, you should get a warning that your scribble is going to be lost...(uggh). I got lucky and somehow was able to pinch and zoom in -- but I have not been able to replicate something so simple. Clearly it's there -- somewhere, but not where would expect it to be consistently (e.g., everywhere would be nice for larger screen users like me). While you can re-size the note background, and scale the content to size -- you cannot move the block of content to make resizing the note more functional. Nor change the pen inking width (that I could find). Moving notes about -- it is very crude feeling for more serious matters. I have yet to find any 'gestures' to rotate notes, but I did find the 90-degree flip... (not like in the demo with slight rotations). I like the idea of the widget on my Fold3, but I find the integration to the main app to be just to awkward to use. It has plenty of potential -- any maybe buried or hidden functionality waiting for a spelunker. I am also sure it's great in select scenarios/use-cases. Overall, it is cute, but awkward. It stumbles as I tried to use it more... Also, some type of sync across devices would be helpful. The plumbing is already in, so provide an option to move the data to a cloud store (many to choose from) to support multiple devices. All in all, some cool stuff, light feel; but misses in a lot of places.

The most recent issue I had was Samsung decided in one of their updates to link notifications status to the calendar status of the built-in calendar (which I don’t use). I noticed my notifications stopped working. After emailing the author, we determined that if I enable my Exchange calendar (which is synced using an app called Nine) in the built-in calendar things might start working again. And they did. Prior to that, Samsung added deep sleeping app and turned the feature on by default. I had to disable the feature, then remove all app from the various sleep lists. This is because even if you disable sleeping apps feature it keeps working if there are apps on any of the sleep lists. Don’t give this app lower than 5 stars.
