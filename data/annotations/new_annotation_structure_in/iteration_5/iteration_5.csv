Thank you developer. You have stated that there is no option to add task at the main app as it is a widget app. I do know that. But I am requesting you to give an option to add tasks in the app itself. As there are some launchers out there those do not give widget option for the app. Yet we want to use this app for its simplistic approach to manage daily tasks. If you consider this suggestion it would be great.,As there are some launchers out there those do not give widget option for the app.
