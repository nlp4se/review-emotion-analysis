It is relatively easy to export to jpg or locally to the device or google drive. -There is a cast button that lets you cast to google devices... like nest hubs and chrome cast... I have not tried in the office with Google Meet conference hardware, but will update when I do. -They don't have their own weird cloud. This app is standalone and does not need an account with whoever devs Squid. -You can lasso inserted photos and move them Bad: -The erase with your finger option is negated by the fact that when the palm rejection doesn't work (which happens often), ends up erasing your notes (I guess this is more problematic for me since I am left handed). I had to turn it off. -There is no option to auto backup to Google Drive or OneDrive. This is particularly upsetting, because unless you remember to manually backup, you may lose your device and your notes. To do that you would have to use Dropbox or Box (i am not about to get another service just for this app). Also, given that those two are the most popular cloud services for business, it makes it impossible for me to propose the adoption of this app at work. -This app is subscription based. Premium features cost per month/year... not single purchase like INKredible. I guess you can buy features one at a time, but that doesn't seem like a good idea to me.
